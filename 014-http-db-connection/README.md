# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I will use this page: https://swapi.dev/

Loading this page (and hence accessing this backend) might fail - if that is the case for you, you can use this alternative: https://swapi.py4e.com/
